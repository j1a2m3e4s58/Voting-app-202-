DCIT 202 project work
Overview 
Electify is a voting app that digitalizes the voting process. Electify was created to make voting easy and efficient. It allows people to vote remotely without the stress of being physically present making voting more convenient.
This is the breakdown of the app;
1.	The Homepage. 
When the app is launched, you are sent to the homepage which gives a brief introduction about the app. After reading, the user then clicks on the “Start voting” button which then takes you to the next page.
2.	The instruction page.
This page displays a list of guidelines that instructs the user in what to do to able to vote. After the instructions are read, the user then clicks on the next button which takes the user to the next page.
3.	The validation page.
In this page, the user would have to input his or her id and click on the verify button. The system then checks the database to see if the id has been registered. If yes then the user is taken to the next page. If not, the user would receive a pop-up that says  ”Invalid id”.
4.	The voting page.
The user is then taken to the voting page where the names of the candidates are displayed. The user then selects the candidate he or she wants to vote for and clicks on the vote button to vote. The user is then taken to the next page.
5.	 The finish page.
This is the end page of the app. This page tells the user the voting was complete.
